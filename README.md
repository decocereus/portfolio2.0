# Decocereus

The source for [decocereus.com](https://www.decocereus.com), Amartya Singh's
personal portfolio.

![Decocereus portfolio preview](./public/opengraph-image.png)

The site is a compact, responsive profile with interactive link previews, a
music player, a GitHub contribution graph, a privacy-safe view of Codex
activity, and a downloadable résumé.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router and React 19
- TypeScript 7
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Base UI-backed shadcn components
- Ultracite, Biome, and React Doctor for code quality

The factual source behind the portfolio is maintained in
[docs/about-amartya.md](./docs/about-amartya.md).

## Development

This repository uses pnpm 11 and requires Node.js 22.13 or newer.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The site works without environment variables. GitHub contribution data is fetched
on the Next.js server from the public profile calendar, without an access token.

## Content and data

Portfolio copy and links live in [`src/lib/constants.ts`](./src/lib/constants.ts).
The factual source behind that copy is maintained in
[`docs/about-amartya.md`](./docs/about-amartya.md); do not strengthen claims
when adapting it.

GitHub contributions use Next.js's one-hour fetch cache. The next visit after
expiry triggers revalidation, so this does not require a cron job or a rebuild.
There is no bundled GitHub snapshot. If data cannot be loaded or parsed, the
section shows an unavailable message and a profile link. The parser reads GitHub's
public HTML calendar, not a versioned API; changes to that markup may require an
update. Only publicly visible contribution activity is included.

Codex activity is
loaded hourly from a public aggregate and similarly falls back to
[`src/lib/codex-usage-snapshot.json`](./src/lib/codex-usage-snapshot.json).
The aggregate contains counts and token totals only—never prompts, titles, or
file paths.

The local exporter can be checked independently with:

```bash
python3 scripts/export-codex-usage.py --self-test
```

## Checks

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm check
pnpm react:doctor
pnpm build
```

`pnpm check` runs Ultracite with its type-aware Biome, React, and Next.js
presets. Use `pnpm fix` for safe autofixes and `pnpm ultracite:doctor` to verify
the tooling setup. `pnpm react:doctor` runs React Doctor without telemetry or
supply-chain scanning.
